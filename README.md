# WireMail: SendGrid

<img alt="SendGrid Logo" src="https://sendgrid.com/brand/sg-twilio/sg-twilio-lockup.svg" width="200px" height="auto">

A ProcessWire module: Extends WireMail to bypass PHP `mail` and send email via SendGrids Web API.

To use this module you'll need a SendGrid account.

> This module is considered beta. It should be safe for production but testing has been limited to ProcessWire master branch version >= 2.8.35 | PHP 7.3. Please report issues if you find them within Github.

## Requirements

* ProcessWire >= 2.8

## Module Use

WireMailSendGrid extends `\ProcessWire\WireMail`. To access its methods, as is the case with all WireMail Classes, you have 3 different methods to generate a new instance:

```
$m = $mail->new(); // option A
$m = wireMail(); // option B
$m = $modules->get('WireMailSendGrid'); // option C
```

Once you have a  `new mail()` instance you can access the public set methods or directly communicate with `\SendGrid\Mail\Mail()` via the modules $email property, i.e.

```
$m = $mail->new();

// call a public method on the module
$m->setTemplateId(<template-id>);

// call a method directly on the \SendGrid\Mail\Mail() instance
$m->email->setClickTracking(<enable>, <enable-text>);
```

For further info on the methods available via  `\SendGrid\Mail\Mail()` see:

## Module Config

Module Config settings are applied globally, so every email sent via WireMailSendGrid will recieve the config you set. You can override the config per instance by calling the modules methods as above.
